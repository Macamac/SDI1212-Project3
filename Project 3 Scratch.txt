Hunter Orc vs Warrior Orc
Sparring

Hunter could use ammo for arrows for loops, math

Warrior can block/ arrows for different loop or hunter dodge/parry attacks


Global Variables:
Htr = "Senko"
War = "Bhishma"
Spar = true



Local Variables
Quiver = #
Slash = 5
WarMaxStam = 20

Array 
Var Aim = ["shoulder", "thigh", "forearm"]
Aim.push("knee")
Arrow in knee joke is passe, hah

Object key:value
students = {"","","",[],function(){},8888};

accessor:
students[key]

function
saHi: function (){
console.log("Hi)};

use function
student.saHi();
student["sayHi"]();

for in loop
for (var key in student) {
console.log("key: " + key + ", value: ", student[key]};
 results=   the key and values of the specified key in raw value cause of comma

Global Variables:
Htr = "Senko"
War = "Bhishma"
Spar = true
Class = ["Hunter", " Shaman", "Warrior]

Bhishma grinned slightly towards Senko under the hot sky, eyes narrowing.
The orc warrior puffed up his chest slightly towards the orc hunter
"A Warrior losing to the likes of a hunter would never happen
Bhishma sparring against Senko in Barren field
//conditional
If spar = true start the spar else part ways

Orc spar more brutal than human, out to draw blood, more honor in eyes of orcs


Bhishma charging for boolean


Use var array at senko taking shots at bhishma
local var for quiver
for loop with shots against bhishma
use Aim.length to run the shots vs number of arrows pulled from quiver against the Aim array
Var Arrow = 4
Aim = ["shoulder", "thigh", "forearm"],
Notch = [1,2,3,4],
Aim.push("knee");
for (var HtrShots = 0, Focus = Aim.length; HtrShots = Focus; HtrShots++,) {
	for
console.log("Senko takes aim at Bhishma's" + aim[HtrShots] + ", pulls back to notch arrow " + Notch[HtrShots] " with " Arrow[HtrShots] " left in hand.")

Bhishma tries to attack Senko, senko dodges three blows
while loop for dodging the 4 sword attacks
use math.floor
WarMaxSlash = Math.floor(WarMaxStam/Slash)
while (WarMaxStam > 1){ WarMaxSlash = Math.floor(WarMaxStam/Slash);
