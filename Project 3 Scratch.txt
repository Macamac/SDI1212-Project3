Spar = true



Local Variables
Quiver = #
Slash = 5

Arrow in knee joke is passe, hah



Story
Bhishma sparring against Senko in Barren field
//conditional
If spar = true start the spar else part ways

Orc spar more brutal than human, out to draw blood, more honor in eyes of orcs


Bhishma tries to attack Senko, senko dodges three blows
while loop for dodging the 4 sword attacks
use math.floor
WarMaxSlash = Math.floor(WarMaxStam/Slash)
while (WarMaxStam > 1){ WarMaxSlash = Math.floor(WarMaxStam/Slash);


Use var array at senko taking shots at bhishma
local var for quiver
for loop with shots against bhishma
use Aim.length to run the shots vs number of arrows pulled from quiver against the Aim array




Nested Conditional
It ends bad or ends well and ends wells with them clasping hands in honor of the spar
